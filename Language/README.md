# Welcome to the lang

## The programming language based on under represented characters.

#### made by Jack Herakovich in spring 2022 at The Westminster Schools.

## Variables
Variables in this language are declared/initialized using the upside down exclamaiton mark symbol "¡". You first announce you are creating a variable, then give it a name and value (no equals sign necessary). For example:

``` ¡x10```

## Functions
Functions are created by announcing them with the capital pi symbol "∏". You first announce the function, then give it a name, then parameters in parantheses, then finally an upside down question mark to begin the function "¿" the function is then ended by the question mark symbol "?" (as curly braces do in java).

```∏ doNothing () ¿ ?```

to call a function type its name then parameters in parantheses, just like java.

```doNothing()```

## Control Flow
For loops: achieved by placing approximately equal to symbol "≈", then use parantheses to set what will be iterated, what it iterates to, and how it iterates, then using question marks to define what will be looped.
While loops: achieved by placing the diamond symbol "◊", then use parantheses to set what will be iterated, what it iterates to, and how it iterates, then using question marks to define what will be looped.
Infinite loops: achieved by placing the infinity symbol "∞", then using question marks to define what will be looped.
(sections inside of parantheses function like java)

```≈(i; i<10; i++)¿?```

if statements are created with the symbol "›" (option shift 4) and else if are created with "»" (option shift vertical bar), and elses are made with "‹" (option shift 3). As in java, following ifs and else ifs you must include parameters in parathenses, and follow these with the question mark symbols as in functions and loops.

```› (x==10) ¿```
```x=x+5?```
   ```» (x<10) ¿```
```x=x-5?```
   ```‹ ¿```
```x=y?```

## Operators
This language solely uses unary operators, and to keep it simple the operators are the same as in Java. + to add, - to subtract, / to divide, and * to multiply.

## Comparators
uses = for assignment, and == for comparison. 
uses < and > as they work in Java.
uses ≤ and ≥ for less than or equal to and greater than or equal to.

## Collections
Arrays are created with the symbol "Å", then their length in parantheses, then a name (no spaces).
```Å(5)arrayName``` 
This language uses the same "add", "set", "get", and "remove" commands as in Java to access and modify arrays.

ArrayLists are created simply by typing "Ålist", then empty parantheses, then a name.
```Ålist()arrayListName```
The commands for access and modification are the same as above.

## Built-in Functions
Not sure yet, want to have some fun ones here though.
